# quarkus-spike-demo

This demo application is a Guestbook for visitors. It includes a REST API for creating and reading guest book entries.

## (1) Running the database
You can either
1) run a containerized & ready-to-use database using `docker-compose ./src/main/docker/docker-compose-db-only.yaml up` in a container
2) or start your own PostgreSQL server with a database called `demo-db` and a user with username `hibernate` and password `hibernate`. Quarkus will create the schema automatically if it does not exist yet.

## (2) Running the application server

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## (3) Using the Application
You can talk to the API endpoints on `localhost:8080` e.g. using postman or your browser. Visit `localhost:8080/guestbook` to
see the API documentation.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/quarkus-spike-demo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
